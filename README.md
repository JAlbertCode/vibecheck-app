## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibecheck-app.git
   cd vibecheck-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LILYPAD_API_URL=https://anura-testnet.lilypad.tech/api/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LILYPAD_API_KEY=your_lilypad_api_key
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

## üé® Dynamic Styling Implementation Plan

For the dynamic styling feature, we plan to:

1. Extract primary colors from each frog's logo using a color extraction library
2. Generate a custom color palette for each frog based on their primary color
3. Apply these colors dynamically to UI elements when viewing or comparing frogs
4. Create unique visual identities that reflect each community's brand
5. Blend colors from both frogs when displaying match results

This will make the app more visually engaging and reinforce the connection between a community's brand and their frog identity.
