   cd vibecheck-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

## üîç Future Search Implementation

For the advanced search functionality, we plan to:

1. Implement text-based search across all profile fields
2. Add advanced filters for tag combinations, creation date, etc.
3. Create saved search functionality for frequent queries
4. Enable semantic search using embeddings for more relevant results
5. Add sorting options for search results (match potential, activity, etc.)

This will make it easier for communities to find the most relevant collaboration partners.
