## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibecheck-app.git
   cd vibecheck-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LILYPAD_API_URL=https://anura-testnet.lilypad.tech/api/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LILYPAD_API_KEY=your_lilypad_api_key
   ```
   
   > **Note**: The app includes a mock mode that works without a Lilypad API key. If you don't provide a valid key, the app will automatically use realistic mock data for community comparisons.

4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.
